# control-page
The first task in Smart Methods company. 
•	create an arm control interface.
•	Create an arm control database.
•	Connecting the database with the control interface.
•	Create php pages to connect the database with the hardware.
The interface contains six engines we can control it by moving the slider to left or to right, each engine moves until 180 degrees. when the button is on the left the value will be 0 degree and we move the button to the right the value increases unlit it be 180 degrees. The final step is to save these values into the database. To create this interface, I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I use XAAMPP to create an arm database to connect the database with the hardware. and lastly, I create a PHP page.
